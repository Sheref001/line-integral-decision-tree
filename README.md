# Line Integral Decision Tree

An interactive, web-based decision tree designed to help students choose the correct line integral formula in multivariable calculus.

## 📌 Purpose

Students often struggle not with *computing* line integrals, but with deciding **which formula applies** in a given problem.  
This tool addresses that difficulty by guiding students step by step through the conceptual decisions involved in line integrals.

Instead of memorizing formulas, students answer a sequence of logical questions and are led to the appropriate integral form.

## 🎓 Intended Audience

- Undergraduate students studying **Calculus III / Multivariable Calculus**
- Instructors looking for interactive teaching or revision tools

## 🧠 What the Tool Does

The decision tree guides students through questions such as:
- Is the curve in the plane or in space?
- Is the field scalar or vector?
- Are we integrating with respect to arc length or coordinates?

Based on the student’s choices, the correct line integral formula is displayed.

## 💡 How Students Use It

1. Open the webpage (link provided by the instructor)
2. Answer each question by clicking an option
3. Follow the path until the correct formula appears
4. Restart and explore different cases

No installation, login, or prior setup is required.
