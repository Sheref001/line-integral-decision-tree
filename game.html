      <p>
        The question of what it means to be beautiful is historically difficult to answer. In 2023,
        Dimitre Dimitrov and George Kroumpouzos published a journal article exploring how human
        beings naturally gravitate toward beauty, referring to beauty as “an integrated part of
        humanity.” The article is able to name several physical characteristics of attractiveness
        according to Western beauty ideals. Yet the article notes that beauty is subjective
        dependent on the viewer. For instance, traits such as fair skin and skin homogeneity are
        regarded as attractive by some cultures, while others favor darker and textured skin.
        Furthermore, the article mentions that one’s perception of beauty is heavily shaped by the
        environment they are raised in. A universal definition of beauty does not apply to everyone,
        contradicting the idea of a one-size-fits-all beauty standard.
